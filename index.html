      Welcome here to the definition of PsiCubed3's letter notation. The original definition was split accross <b>SIX</b> blog posts! And that is including:
      <ul>
        <li>the informal extension to a mathmatically informal notation</li>
        <li>the lexicographical ordering</li>
        <li>and the mathmatically formal definition</li>
      </ul>
      So, this place will have all of that. It will be split across multiple pages, but it's now all in one place, more organized to!
